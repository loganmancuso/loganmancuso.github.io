  Welcome! I'm Logan, a Senior Automations Engineer with over eight years of experience designing and deploying Infrastructure-as-Code (IaC) solutions. 
  My work focuses on streamlining cloud and on-prem infrastructure through modular workflows, and automated pipelines.
  </br> </br>

  In my personal projects, I'm constantly exploring ways to eliminate repetitive tasks through automation. 
  Most recently, I've been contributing to the development of a Terraform provider for Proxmox. 
  This includes building custom cloud-init images with Packer, preconfigured with Docker and essential monitoring services. 
  Terraform then provisions and orchestrates the VM cluster, with tagging and metrics collection.
  Automated pipelines trigger predefined bundles of Docker services to be deployed to the VM cluster allowing me to manage my applications with ease.
  </br> </br>
  
  Currently, I'm self-hosting several key services:
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Nginx Proxy Manager</strong> for SSL and internal HTTPS routing</li>
    <li><strong>Komodo</strong> as my container orchestration UI</li>
    <li><strong>Grafana</strong> as my metrics dashboard</li>
    <li><strong>Prometheus</strong> as my metrics collection endpoint</li>
    <li><strong>OpenTelemetry</strong> as my on-node metrics collector</li>
    <li><strong>NextCloud</strong> for file synchronization</li>
    <li><strong>Home Assistant</strong> for centralized home automation</li>
  </ul>


  This lab serves as a testbed for new ideas, allowing me to prototype and refine production-grade tooling in a controlled environment.
